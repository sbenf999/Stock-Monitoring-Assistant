#this program should create the setup instructions for the program

# todo:
#     - check if staticSetUpState.txt is true or false (this should be automatically false)
#     - if it is false, when the mainApp.py file is run, this program should be run
#     - it should:
#         - ask for database credentials
#         - test connection to the database
#         - create the necessary tables and potentially an admin user
